Repo for HappMe web app

HappMe is a mood analyzer and mood improvement app. We thought that in today's busy world it would be nice to have an app that people can turn to when they're a tad tired or down, and the app will diagnose the user's mood and deliver music, video and written words with the intent of cheering the user up a bit. 

If the user is already in a heightened state, then the app will basically give a high-five and keep on truckin' message.

The Front-End

The front-end team utilized HTML/CSS in combination with the Google-owned responsive CSS-framework - Materialize - to create a pleasing and user-responsive interface. Jquery and Javascript were also used to bridge to the back-end code.

The Back-End

For the back-end team, the primary challenge was creating code that delivered the music that was appropriate to the user's mood, plus a youtube-sourced video to match. The key logic captured the user's mood and converted the mood to a number, called a musuic API and retrieved the music that matched that number. A youtube call then provided the accompanying video. 

All of the code in the HTML and Javascript is well-documented, allowing the code reader to read the code like reading a book. Hopefully an enjoyable book.
